## Customizing your status page

The service description and link displayed on your status page are automatically taken from your repository's **Description** and **Homepage** fields on GitHub. To change them:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click the gear icon (⚙️) or "Settings".
3. Edit the **Description** and **Homepage** fields at the top of the repository page.
4. Save your changes — your status page will update automatically.

This makes it easy to personalize your status page without editing any code.
